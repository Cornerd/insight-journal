# Story 2.7: Implement Manual Re-analysis Functionality

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to manually trigger re-analysis of my journal entries,
**so that** I can get updated insights when I've made significant changes or want fresh perspectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **2.7.1:** A "Re-analyze" button is prominently displayed when viewing journal entries with existing AI analysis.
2. **2.7.2:** Clicking the re-analyze button clears existing analysis and triggers a fresh AI request.
3. **2.7.3:** The button includes appropriate visual feedback (cursor pointer, hover effects).
4. **2.7.4:** New analysis results replace the previous ones and are saved to localStorage.
5. **2.7.5:** The button is disabled during analysis to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Add Re-analyze button to AI analysis display (AC: 2.7.1, 2.7.3)
  - [x] Add button to `MarkdownEditor.tsx` in AI analysis section
  - [x] Position button prominently with clear "ðŸ”„ Re-analyze" label
  - [x] Implement proper CSS styling with hover effects
  - [x] Add `cursor-pointer` class for proper user interaction feedback

- [x] Task 2: Implement re-analysis functionality (AC: 2.7.2, 2.7.4)
  - [x] Add `clearAnalysis` function to `useAIAnalysis` hook
  - [x] Implement button click handler to clear cache and trigger new analysis
  - [x] Ensure new results overwrite previous analysis in localStorage
  - [x] Update journal entry with fresh analysis results

- [x] Task 3: Implement button state management (AC: 2.7.5)
  - [x] Disable button during analysis loading state
  - [x] Show appropriate loading indicator when re-analysis is in progress
  - [x] Re-enable button after analysis completion or error
  - [x] Handle button visibility based on analysis availability

- [x] Task 4: Add user experience enhancements
  - [x] Add tooltip explaining re-analysis functionality
  - [x] Implement smooth transitions for button state changes
  - [x] Ensure button is only visible when analysis exists
  - [x] Add confirmation for re-analysis to prevent accidental clicks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Leverages caching system from Story 2.6 for result storage
- Uses error handling patterns from Story 2.5 for re-analysis failures
- Integrates with loading states from Story 2.5

### Data Models
- **AIAnalysis Interface**: Reuses existing structure for new analysis results
- **JournalEntry Interface**: Uses existing `aiAnalysis` field for updates
- No new data models required - leverages existing analysis storage

### API Specifications
- Uses existing AI analysis API endpoints
- No new API routes required
- Leverages existing error handling and response processing

### Component Specifications
- **MarkdownEditor Component**: Enhanced with re-analyze button
  - Button positioned in AI analysis header section
  - Conditional rendering based on analysis availability
  - Integrated with existing loading and error states
- **useAIAnalysis Hook**: Extended with manual trigger functionality
  - `clearAnalysis()` function to reset analysis state
  - Force re-analysis bypassing cache mechanisms
  - Proper state management for button interactions

### File Locations
- `src/features/editor/components/MarkdownEditor.tsx` - Button implementation
- `src/features/ai-insights/hooks/useAIAnalysis.ts` - Re-analysis logic
- `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx` - Display integration

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for re-analysis button functionality
- Integration tests for cache clearing and new analysis
- User interaction tests for button states
- Error handling tests for re-analysis failures

### Technical Constraints
- Button must respect existing loading states
- Re-analysis should bypass all caching mechanisms
- New results must completely replace previous analysis
- Button styling must match existing design system

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `src/features/editor/components/__tests__/MarkdownEditor.test.tsx`
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Button interactions and state management
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock AI analysis hook and journal store

### Test Cases
1. **Button Visibility Tests**
   - Button appears when analysis exists
   - Button hidden when no analysis available
   - Button properly positioned in UI

2. **Button Interaction Tests**
   - Click triggers re-analysis function
   - Button disabled during loading
   - Hover effects work correctly
   - Cursor pointer displayed on hover

3. **Re-analysis Functionality Tests**
   - Cache cleared before new analysis
   - New analysis request triggered
   - Results properly saved to localStorage
   - Previous analysis completely replaced

4. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Button re-enabled after analysis errors
   - Error states properly displayed
   - User can retry after failures
