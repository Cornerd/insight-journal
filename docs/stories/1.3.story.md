# Story 1.3: Display Saved Journal Entries as a History List

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to view a list of my previously saved journal entries,
**so that** I can easily browse my past reflections.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **1.3.1:** A dedicated section or component on the `/journal` page displays a list of all saved journal entries.
2. **1.3.2:** Each item in the list clearly shows the date/time of the entry.
3. **1.3.3:** Clicking on a list item navigates the user to view the full content of that specific journal entry.
4. **1.3.4:** The list is ordered chronologically (e.g., newest entry first).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create journal list component (AC: 1.3.1)
  - [ ] Create `src/features/journal/components/JournalList.tsx`
  - [ ] Implement list rendering with proper styling
  - [ ] Add empty state component for when no entries exist
  - [ ] Integrate with Zustand store to fetch entries

- [ ] Task 2: Create journal card component (AC: 1.3.2)
  - [ ] Create `src/features/journal/components/JournalCard.tsx`
  - [ ] Display entry date/time with proper formatting
  - [ ] Show entry preview (first few lines)
  - [ ] Add responsive design for mobile/desktop

- [ ] Task 3: Implement entry navigation (AC: 1.3.3)
  - [ ] Create individual entry route `/journal/[id]`
  - [ ] Create `src/app/journal/[id]/page.tsx`
  - [ ] Implement entry detail view
  - [ ] Add navigation between list and detail views

- [ ] Task 4: Implement chronological sorting (AC: 1.3.4)
  - [ ] Add sorting logic in journal store
  - [ ] Implement date-based sorting (newest first)
  - [ ] Add sorting options (newest/oldest first)
  - [ ] Optimize sorting performance for large lists

- [ ] Task 5: Enhance journal page layout
  - [ ] Update `/journal` page to include list component
  - [ ] Implement responsive layout (editor + list)
  - [ ] Add proper spacing and visual hierarchy
  - [ ] Ensure mobile-friendly design

- [ ] Task 6: Unit Testing
  - [ ] Write tests for JournalList component
  - [ ] Write tests for JournalCard component
  - [ ] Write tests for entry navigation
  - [ ] Write tests for sorting functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1: Created journal page and markdown editor
- Story 1.2: Implemented localStorage saving functionality
This story builds on both by displaying saved entries in a user-friendly list format.

### Data Models
**Journal Entry Display** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
interface JournalEntry {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  title?: string;
}

// For list display
interface JournalListItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  preview: string;      // First 100 characters of content
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications
No external APIs required. Data comes from localStorage via journal store.

### Component Specifications
**JournalList Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/journal/components/JournalList.tsx`
- Props: `{ entries: JournalEntry[], onEntryClick: (id: string) => void }`
- Features: Virtualization for large lists, loading states
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**JournalCard Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/journal/components/JournalCard.tsx`
- Props: `{ entry: JournalEntry, onClick: () => void }`
- Display: Date, title/preview, click interaction
- Styling: Card design with hover effects

**Entry Detail Page** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/app/journal/[id]/page.tsx`
- Dynamic routing for individual entries
- Full content display with edit capabilities
- Navigation back to list

### File Locations
Based on Feature-Sliced Design pattern [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- List component: `src/features/journal/components/JournalList.tsx`
- Card component: `src/features/journal/components/JournalCard.tsx`
- Empty state: `src/features/journal/components/EmptyState.tsx`
- Detail page: `src/app/journal/[id]/page.tsx`
- Hooks: `src/features/journal/hooks/useJournalEntries.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Next.js 14.2.5 App Router for dynamic routing
- React 18.2.0 for component rendering
- Zustand 4.5.0 for state management
- date-fns 3.3.1 for date formatting
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 for styling

**Performance Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture.md#performance]:
- Virtualization for large lists (react-window if needed)
- Lazy loading of entry content
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo
- Efficient sorting algorithms

**Responsive Design** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ui-pattern]:
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Proper spacing and typography

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
- Framework: Jest 29.7.0 + Testing Library 14.2.1
- Test file location: `tests/unit/features/journal/components/`
- Test user interactions (clicking, navigation)
- Test responsive behavior
- Test empty state scenarios
- Mock Next.js router for navigation tests
