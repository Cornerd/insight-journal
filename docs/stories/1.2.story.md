# Story 1.2: Save Journal Entry to Local Storage

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to save my written journal entry locally,
**so that** my thoughts are preserved even after closing the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **1.2.1:** When the "Save" button is clicked, the content of the journal entry is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
2. **1.2.2:** Each journal entry stored in `localStorage` includes a unique identifier and a timestamp (date/time of creation/last update).
3. **1.2.3:** A success message or visual confirmation is displayed to the user upon successful saving.
4. **1.2.4:** The saved entry can be retrieved from `localStorage` in a subsequent session.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement localStorage service (AC: 1.2.1, 1.2.4)
  - [ ] Create `src/features/journal/services/storageService.ts`
  - [ ] Implement save journal entry function
  - [ ] Implement retrieve journal entries function
  - [ ] Add error handling for localStorage operations
  - [ ] Implement data serialization/deserialization

- [ ] Task 2: Create journal data model and ID generation (AC: 1.2.2)
  - [ ] Implement unique ID generation using nanoid
  - [ ] Add timestamp fields (createdAt, updatedAt)
  - [ ] Create journal entry validation logic
  - [ ] Implement data structure versioning for future migrations

- [ ] Task 3: Integrate save functionality with editor (AC: 1.2.1, 1.2.3)
  - [ ] Connect Save button to storage service
  - [ ] Implement save handler in journal page
  - [ ] Add loading state during save operation
  - [ ] Show success/error feedback to user

- [ ] Task 4: Implement Zustand store for journal state (AC: 1.2.1)
  - [ ] Create `src/shared/store/journalStore.ts`
  - [ ] Implement journal entries state management
  - [ ] Add persist middleware for automatic localStorage sync
  - [ ] Implement optimistic updates for better UX

- [ ] Task 5: Unit Testing
  - [ ] Write tests for storageService functions
  - [ ] Write tests for journal store operations
  - [ ] Write tests for save functionality integration
  - [ ] Write tests for data persistence across sessions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 created the journal page and markdown editor. This story builds on that foundation by adding data persistence capabilities.

### Data Models
**Journal Entry Structure** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
interface JournalEntry {
  id: string;           // nanoid generated unique identifier
  content: string;      // Markdown content from editor
  createdAt: Date;      // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;      // Last modification timestamp
  title?: string;       // Optional title (first line or derived)
}

// Storage format in localStorage
interface StorageData {
  version: string;      // Data format version for migrations
  entries: JournalEntry[];
}
```

### API Specifications
No external API endpoints required. All operations use browser localStorage API.

### Component Specifications
**Storage Service** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/journal/services/storageService.ts`
- Functions: `saveEntry()`, `getEntries()`, `getEntry()`, `deleteEntry()`
- Error handling for localStorage quota exceeded
- Data validation and sanitization

**Zustand Store** [Source: docs/architecture.md#state-management]:
- Location: `src/shared/store/journalStore.ts`
- State: `{ entries: JournalEntry[], currentEntry: JournalEntry | null }`
- Actions: `addEntry()`, `updateEntry()`, `deleteEntry()`, `setCurrentEntry()`
- Persist middleware: Automatic sync with localStorage

### File Locations
Based on Feature-Sliced Design pattern [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Storage service: `src/features/journal/services/storageService.ts`
- Journal store: `src/shared/store/journalStore.ts`
- Utility functions: `src/shared/lib/utils/storage.ts`
- Types: `src/features/journal/types/journal.types.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Zustand 4.5.0 with persist middleware
- Immer 10.0.3 for immutable state updates
- nanoid 5.0.5 for unique ID generation
- date-fns 3.3.1 for date handling
- localStorage API (browser native)

**Storage Limitations** [Source: docs/architecture.md#data-pattern]:
- localStorage capacity: ~5-10MB
- Single-device limitation (MVP constraint)
- Data persistence only within same browser/domain
- Future migration path to cloud storage planned

**Error Handling** [Source: docs/architecture.md#error-handling]:
- Handle localStorage quota exceeded
- Handle localStorage disabled/unavailable
- Graceful degradation when storage fails
- User feedback for storage errors

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
- Framework: Jest 29.7.0
- Test file location: `tests/unit/features/journal/services/`
- Mock localStorage for testing
- Test data persistence across mock sessions
- Test error scenarios (quota exceeded, disabled localStorage)
