# Story 1.1: Implement Journaling Page UI and Markdown Editor

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to access a dedicated journaling page with a markdown-enabled text editor,
**so that** I can easily write and format my daily reflections.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **1.1.1:** A new page accessible via the `/journal` route is created.
2. **1.1.2:** The `/journal` page displays a prominent, multi-line text input area suitable for writing journal entries.
3. **1.1.3:** The text input area supports basic Markdown formatting (e.g., bold, italics, headings).
4. **1.1.4:** The page includes a clear "Save" button to submit the journal entry.
5. **1.1.5:** The UI is responsive, adapting well to both mobile and desktop screen sizes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 1, so no previous story context available.

### Data Models
**Journal Entry Structure** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
// From entities/journal.ts
interface JournalEntry {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier (nanoid)
  content: string;      // Markdown content
  createdAt: Date;      // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;      // Last modification timestamp
  title?: string;       // Optional title derived from content
}
```

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story - data will be handled locally through storage service.

- Library: @uiw/react-md-editor v4.0.0
- Props: `{ value: string, onChange: (value: string) => void, placeholder?: string }`
- State Management: Connect to Zustand store for editor content

**Journal Page Layout** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/app/journal/page.tsx`
- Layout: `src/app/journal/layout.tsx`
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes

### File Locations
