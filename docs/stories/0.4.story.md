# Story 0.4: Setup Vercel Deployment

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure the project for automated deployment to Vercel,
**so that** changes pushed to the main branch are automatically built and deployed, enabling continuous delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **0.4.1:** The project is configured to deploy correctly on Vercel.
2. **0.4.2:** A basic "Hello World" or initial landing page is successfully deployed to a Vercel URL.
3. **0.4.3:** Environment variables (specifically `OPENAI_API_KEY`) can be securely configured in Vercel's project settings.
4. **0.4.4:** Subsequent commits to the main branch trigger new successful deployments on Vercel.

- Story 0.2: Configured development tools
- Story 0.3: Setup environment variable handling
This story completes the infrastructure setup by enabling automated deployment.

### Data Models
No specific data models required. This story focuses on deployment configuration and initial UI.

### API Specifications
No API specifications required for this story. Focus is on deployment infrastructure.

### Component Specifications
**Landing Page Components** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Features: App introduction, feature highlights, navigation
- Styling: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Content: Clear value proposition and call-to-action

**Vercel Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture.md#deployment]:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Install command: `npm install`
- Node.js version: 20.x

### File Locations
Deployment and configuration files [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Landing page: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Vercel config: `vercel.json` (if needed)
- Build config: `next.config.mjs`
- Package scripts: `package.json`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Vercel hosting platform
- Next.js 14.2.5 with App Router
- Node.js 20.11.0 runtime
- Automatic optimizations and CDN

**Deployment Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture.md#deployment]:
- Automatic deployments from main branch
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Environment variable management
- Build optimization and caching

**Vercel Configuration**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

### Landing Page Design
**Content Structure** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ui-design]:
```typescript
interface LandingPageContent {
  hero: {
    title: string;
    subtitle: string;
    cta: string;
  };
  features: Array<{
    title: string;
    description: string;
    icon: string;
  }>;
  footer: {
    description: string;
    links: Array<{ text: string; href: string }>;
  };
}
```

**Landing Page Features**:
- Hero section with app introduction
- Feature highlights (AI insights, local storage, responsive design)
- Call-to-action button to start journaling
- Clean, meditative design matching app branding

### Environment Variable Configuration
**Vercel Environment Variables**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Production OpenAI API key
- `NODE_ENV`: Automatically set to "production"
- `VERCEL_URL`: Automatically provided by Vercel
- Custom variables as needed for production

**Environment Setup Process**:
1. Navigate to Vercel project settings
2. Go to Environment Variables section
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with production value
4. Configure for Production environment
5. Redeploy to apply changes

### Deployment Pipeline
**Automatic Deployment Triggers**:
- Push to main branch ‚Üí Production deployment
- Pull request creation ‚Üí Preview deployment
- Manual deployment via Vercel dashboard
- API-triggered deployments

**Build Process**:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Run linting and type checking
3. Build Next.js application (`npm run build`)
4. Deploy to Vercel edge network
5. Invalidate CDN cache

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
- Manual verification of deployment process
- Test deployed application functionality
- Verify environment variable access
- Test continuous deployment pipeline

**Verification Steps**:
1. **Local Build**: Verify `npm run build` succeeds
2. **Initial Deployment**: Test first deployment to Vercel
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify API key access in production
4. **Continuous Deployment**: Test automatic deployments
5. **Performance**: Check deployed app performance and loading

**Test Scenarios**:
- Deploy with missing environment variables
- Test deployment rollback functionality
- Verify preview deployments for pull requests
- Test custom domain configuration (if applicable)
- Check deployment logs for errors

### Deployment Checklist
**Pre-deployment Verification**:
- [ ] Project builds successfully locally
- [ ] Environment variables are configured
- [ ] Landing page displays correctly
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Build optimization is enabled

**Post-deployment Verification**:
- [ ] Deployed site loads without errors
- [ ] Environment variables are accessible
- [ ] Landing page renders correctly
- [ ] Navigation works as expected
- [ ] Performance metrics are acceptable

### Common Issues and Solutions
**Potential Deployment Issues**:
1. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure proper configuration in Vercel
3. **Import Errors**: Verify all dependencies are in package.json
4. **Performance**: Optimize images and assets for production
5. **Domain Issues**: Configure custom domain if needed

- ‚úÖ Project deploys successfully to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Landing page is accessible via Vercel URL
- ‚úÖ Environment variables work in production
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployments trigger on main branch commits
- ‚úÖ Build process completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Deployed application performs well

### Landing Page Content
