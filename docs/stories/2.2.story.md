# Story 2.2: Implement Journal Entry Summarization with AI

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive an AI-generated summary of my journal entry,
**so that** I can quickly grasp the main points of my reflections without re-reading the entire text.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **2.2.1:** When a journal entry is saved or viewed, a request is made to the OpenAI API to generate a concise summary.
2. **2.2.2:** A carefully crafted prompt is used to guide the AI in generating a relevant and accurate summary.
3. **2.2.3:** The generated summary is displayed clearly on the journal entry view page.
4. **2.2.4:** A loading indicator is shown while the AI summary is being generated.
5. **2.2.5:** The summary is saved along with the journal entry in `localStorage`.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1: Established OpenAI API integration and error handling
This story builds on that foundation to implement the first AI feature: journal summarization.

### Data Models
**Enhanced Journal Entry with AI Analysis** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
interface JournalEntry {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  title?: string;
  aiAnalysis?: AIAnalysis;
}

interface AIAnalysis {
  summary: string;
  generatedAt: Date;
  model: string;
  tokenUsage?: {
    prompt: number;
    completion: number;
    total: number;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**AI Analysis Endpoint**:
- Route: `POST /api/ai/analyze`
- Request: `{ content: string, entryId: string }`
- Response: `{ summary: string, tokenUsage: object }`
- Error handling: Rate limits, API failures, invalid content

### Component Specifications
**AIAnalysisCard Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Props: `{ analysis: AIAnalysis | null, isLoading: boolean, error?: string }`
- Features: Summary display, loading spinner, error states
- Styling: Card design with proper typography

**useAIAnalysis Hook** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/ai-insights/hooks/useAIAnalysis.ts`
- Functions: `analyzeEntry()`, loading state management
- Error handling: Network errors, API failures
- Caching: Avoid duplicate analysis requests

### File Locations
Based on Feature-Sliced Design pattern [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- API route: `src/app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`
- Prompt templates: `src/features/ai-insights/services/promptTemplates.ts`
- AI analysis hook: `src/features/ai-insights/hooks/useAIAnalysis.ts`
- AI results component: `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Updated journal types: `src/features/journal/types/journal.types.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- OpenAI SDK 4.28.0 for API calls
- Next.js 14.2.5 API Routes for backend processing
- React 18.2.0 hooks for state management
- Zustand 4.5.0 for global state updates
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 for component styling

**AI Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ai-integration]:
- Model: GPT-3.5-turbo (cost-effective for summaries)
- Temperature: 0.3 (more focused, less creative)
- Max tokens: 150-200 for summaries
- System prompt: Structured for consistent summarization

**Performance Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture.md#performance]:
- Debounce analysis requests to avoid excessive API calls
- Cache analysis results to prevent duplicate processing
- Implement request queuing for multiple entries
- Show immediate feedback with loading states

### Prompt Engineering
**Summarization Prompt Template**:
```
System: You are a helpful assistant that creates concise summaries of personal journal entries. Focus on the main themes, emotions, and key insights. Keep summaries to 2-3 sentences maximum.

User: Please summarize this journal entry:
{journal_content}

Provide a brief, empathetic summary that captures the essence of the entry.
```

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
- Framework: Jest 29.7.0 + Testing Library 14.2.1
- Test file location: `tests/unit/features/ai-insights/`
- Mock OpenAI API responses for consistent testing
- Test loading states and error scenarios
- Integration tests with journal workflow

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Successful summary generation
- API error handling
- Loading state management
- Summary display and formatting
- Integration with journal save workflow
