# Story 2.4: Generate Personalized Suggestions with AI

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive personalized suggestions based on my journal entry and emotional state,
**so that** I can gain actionable insights and support for my personal growth and well-being.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **2.4.1:** After summarization and emotion analysis, a final request is made to the OpenAI API to generate tailored suggestions.
2. **2.4.2:** The prompt for suggestions incorporates the summary, emotional analysis, and potentially a user's identified pain points or goals (if available from the entry).
3. **2.4.3:** Suggestions are practical, supportive, and relevant to the journal entry's content and identified emotions (e.g., stress reduction tips, mindfulness exercises, positive affirmations).
4. **2.4.4:** The AI-generated suggestions are displayed clearly on the journal entry view page.
5. **2.4.5:** The generated suggestions are saved along with the journal entry in `localStorage`.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1: Established OpenAI API integration
- Story 2.2: Implemented journal summarization
- Story 2.3: Added emotion analysis
This story completes the AI analysis trilogy by adding personalized suggestions based on the summary and emotional context.

### Data Models
**Complete AI Analysis with Suggestions** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
interface AIAnalysis {
  summary: string;
  sentiment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
  emotions: EmotionTag[];
  suggestions: Suggestion[];
  confidence: number;
  generatedAt: Date;
  model: string;
  tokenUsage?: TokenUsage;
}

interface Suggestion {
  id: string;
  category: SuggestionCategory;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  actionable: boolean;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

type SuggestionCategory = 
  | 'wellness' 
  | 'mindfulness' 
  | 'productivity' 
  | 'reflection' 
  | 'social' 
  | 'physical';
```

### API Specifications
**Complete AI Analysis Endpoint**:
- Route: `POST /api/ai/analyze`
- Request: `{ content: string, entryId: string, analysisTypes: string[] }`
- Response: `{ summary: string, sentiment: string, emotions: EmotionTag[], suggestions: Suggestion[], tokenUsage: object }`
- Processing: Sequential AI calls for comprehensive analysis

### Component Specifications
**SuggestionsList Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/ai-insights/components/SuggestionsList.tsx`
- Props: `{ suggestions: Suggestion[], onSuggestionClick?: (suggestion: Suggestion) => void }`
- Features: Categorized suggestions, priority indicators, actionable formatting
- Styling: Card-based layout with category colors

**Enhanced AIAnalysisCard Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Updates: Include suggestions section
- Features: Complete AI analysis display (summary + emotions + suggestions)
- Layout: Organized tabs or sections for different analysis types

### File Locations
Based on Feature-Sliced Design pattern [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Suggestions component: `src/features/ai-insights/components/SuggestionsList.tsx`
- Updated AI card: `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Prompt templates: `src/features/ai-insights/services/promptTemplates.ts`
- AI analysis types: `src/features/ai-insights/types/analysis.types.ts`
- Updated API route: `src/app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- OpenAI SDK 4.28.0 for suggestion generation
- React 18.2.0 for suggestion display components
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 for suggestion styling
- nanoid 5.0.5 for suggestion IDs

**AI Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ai-integration]:
- Model: GPT-3.5-turbo for suggestion generation
- Temperature: 0.5 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- Max tokens: 200-300 for suggestions
- Context window: Include summary and emotions for context

**Performance Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture.md#performance]:
- Sequential API calls: summary → emotions → suggestions
- Progressive UI updates: Show results as they become available
- Token optimization: Efficient prompt design
- Caching: Store complete analysis to avoid regeneration

### Prompt Engineering
**Suggestion Generation Prompt Template**:
```
System: You are a supportive wellness coach who provides practical, actionable suggestions based on journal entries. Focus on mental health, productivity, and personal growth.

User: Based on this journal analysis, provide 3-5 personalized suggestions:

Summary: {summary}
Emotions: {emotions}
Sentiment: {sentiment}

Provide suggestions in these categories as relevant:
- Wellness (mental/physical health)
- Mindfulness (meditation, reflection)
- Productivity (goal-setting, time management)
- Social (relationships, communication)

Format as JSON:
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "category": "wellness",
      "title": "Brief title",
      "description": "Actionable description",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```
