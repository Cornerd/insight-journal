# Story 3.3: Implement Data Migration from localStorage

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to migrate my existing journal entries from local storage to the cloud,
**so that** I don't lose any of my previous entries when I create an account.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **3.3.1:** System detects existing localStorage data when user first logs in.
2. **3.3.2:** Users are prompted to migrate their local data to the cloud.
3. **3.3.3:** Migration process preserves all journal content and AI analysis.
4. **3.3.4:** Users can choose to keep or clear local data after migration.
5. **3.3.5:** Migration handles conflicts between local and cloud data gracefully.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement localStorage data detection (AC: 3.3.1)
  - [ ] Create utility to scan for existing journal data in localStorage
  - [ ] Detect AI analysis data associated with journal entries
  - [ ] Count and validate local data integrity
  - [ ] Check for data format compatibility

- [ ] Task 2: Create migration UI and user flow (AC: 3.3.2)
  - [ ] Design migration prompt modal/page
  - [ ] Show preview of data to be migrated
  - [ ] Implement migration progress indicator
  - [ ] Add option to skip migration

- [ ] Task 3: Implement data preservation during migration (AC: 3.3.3)
  - [ ] Create data transformation utilities for cloud format
  - [ ] Preserve all journal entry metadata (dates, titles, content)
  - [ ] Migrate AI analysis results with proper linking
  - [ ] Maintain data relationships and integrity

- [ ] Task 4: Implement post-migration options (AC: 3.3.4)
  - [ ] Provide option to keep local data as backup
  - [ ] Implement secure local data clearing
  - [ ] Show migration summary and confirmation
  - [ ] Allow users to undo migration if needed

- [ ] Task 5: Handle migration conflicts (AC: 3.3.5)
  - [ ] Detect conflicts between local and existing cloud data
  - [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies (merge, replace, skip)
  - [ ] Allow user choice for conflict resolution
  - [ ] Provide detailed conflict information to users

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Depends on authentication system from Story 3.1
- Requires cloud storage implementation from Story 3.2
- Uses existing localStorage structure from Epic 1

### Data Models
- **MigrationData Interface**: Structure for migration payload
  - `journalEntries: LocalJournalEntry[]` - Local journal data
  - `aiAnalysis: LocalAIAnalysis[]` - Local AI analysis data
  - `metadata: MigrationMetadata` - Migration information
- **ConflictResolution Interface**: Conflict handling options
  - `strategy: 'merge' | 'replace' | 'skip'` - Resolution strategy
  - `conflictedEntries: ConflictEntry[]` - Entries with conflicts
- **MigrationStatus Interface**: Progress tracking
  - `total: number` - Total items to migrate
  - `completed: number` - Items successfully migrated
  - `failed: number` - Items that failed migration
  - `conflicts: number` - Items with conflicts

### API Specifications
- **Migration API**: `/api/migration/` endpoints for data transfer
- **Conflict Detection**: Compare local vs cloud data timestamps and content
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk data transfer to cloud
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time migration status updates

### Component Specifications
- **MigrationWizard**: Step-by-step migration interface
- **DataPreview**: Shows local data summary before migration
- **ConflictResolver**: Interface for handling data conflicts
- **MigrationProgress**: Real-time progress indicator
- **PostMigrationSummary**: Results and next steps

### File Locations
- `src/features/migration/` - Migration-specific components and logic
- `src/features/migration/services/migrationService.ts` - Core migration logic
- `src/features/migration/components/MigrationWizard.tsx` - Main UI
- `src/features/migration/hooks/useMigration.ts` - Migration state management
- `src/app/migration/` - Migration pages and routes

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for data transformation and conflict detection
- Integration tests for complete migration flows
- Edge case testing for corrupted or incomplete local data
- Performance tests for large datasets

### Technical Constraints
- Migration must be atomic - either complete success or rollback
- Must handle large amounts of local data efficiently
- Network failures during migration must be recoverable
- User must be able to cancel migration at any point

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `src/features/migration/__tests__/`
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library, MSW for API mocking
- **Coverage**: Minimum 85% coverage for migration logic
- **Data Testing**: Test with various localStorage data scenarios

### Test Cases
1. **Data Detection Tests**
   - Test detection of various localStorage data formats
   - Test handling of corrupted or incomplete local data
   - Test data validation and integrity checks
   - Test empty localStorage scenarios

2. **Migration Process Tests**
   - Test complete migration flow from start to finish
   - Test migration progress tracking and updates
   - Test migration cancellation and cleanup
   - Test network failure recovery during migration

3. **Conflict Resolution Tests**
   - Test detection of conflicts between local and cloud data
   - Test different conflict resolution strategies
   - Test user choice handling for conflicts
   - Test merge operations for conflicted data

4. **Data Preservation Tests**
   - Test that all local data is accurately migrated
   - Test preservation of AI analysis relationships
   - Test metadata and timestamp preservation
   - Test data format transformation accuracy
