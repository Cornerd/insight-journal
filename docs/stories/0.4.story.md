    description: string;
    icon: string;
  }>;
  footer: {
    description: string;
    links: Array<{ text: string; href: string }>;
  };
}
```

**Landing Page Features**:
- Hero section with app introduction
- Feature highlights (AI insights, local storage, responsive design)
- Call-to-action button to start journaling
- Clean, meditative design matching app branding

### Environment Variable Configuration
**Vercel Environment Variables**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Production OpenAI API key
- `NODE_ENV`: Automatically set to "production"
- `VERCEL_URL`: Automatically provided by Vercel
- Custom variables as needed for production

**Environment Setup Process**:
1. Navigate to Vercel project settings
2. Go to Environment Variables section
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with production value
4. Configure for Production environment
5. Redeploy to apply changes

### Deployment Pipeline
**Automatic Deployment Triggers**:
- Push to main branch ‚Üí Production deployment
- Pull request creation ‚Üí Preview deployment
- Manual deployment via Vercel dashboard
- API-triggered deployments

**Build Process**:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Run linting and type checking
3. Build Next.js application (`npm run build`)
4. Deploy to Vercel edge network
5. Invalidate CDN cache

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
