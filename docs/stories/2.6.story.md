# Story 2.6: Implement Smart Caching System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to avoid waiting for AI analysis when my content hasn't significantly changed,
**so that** I can quickly access my insights without unnecessary delays or costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **2.6.1:** The system automatically detects when journal content has changed significantly (>50 characters or >20% change).
2. **2.6.2:** Previously generated AI analysis is cached and reused when content changes are minimal.
3. **2.6.3:** Cached analysis results are automatically loaded when opening existing journal entries.
4. **2.6.4:** The system handles different analysis types (summary, emotion, full) with appropriate compatibility checking.
5. **2.6.5:** Cache data persists across browser sessions using localStorage.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement content change detection algorithm (AC: 2.6.1)
  - [x] Create content comparison logic in `useAIAnalysis.ts`
  - [x] Implement character count and percentage change thresholds
  - [x] Add debug logging for content change analysis
  - [x] Test with various content modification scenarios

- [x] Task 2: Implement analysis result caching (AC: 2.6.2, 2.6.5)
  - [x] Modify `updateEntry` in journal store to save AI analysis
  - [x] Update storage service to handle `aiAnalysis` field serialization
  - [x] Implement Date object serialization/deserialization for `generatedAt`
  - [x] Add cache validation and integrity checks

- [x] Task 3: Implement automatic cache loading (AC: 2.6.3)
  - [x] Add useEffect in `useAIAnalysis` to load cached results
  - [x] Implement Zustand store subscription for real-time updates
  - [x] Handle initial state loading when component mounts
  - [x] Add proper state synchronization between hook and store

- [x] Task 4: Implement analysis type compatibility (AC: 2.6.4)
  - [x] Create compatibility checking logic for analysis types
  - [x] Allow 'full' analysis to satisfy 'summary' or 'emotion' requests
  - [x] Implement smart cache reuse based on analysis comprehensiveness
  - [x] Add type-specific cache validation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Error handling patterns from Story 2.5 are reused for cache failures
- Loading state management from Story 2.5 is extended for cache operations

### Data Models
- **AIAnalysis Interface**: Extended with proper type definitions for caching
  - `generatedAt: Date` - Timestamp for cache validation
  - `type: 'summary' | 'emotion' | 'full' | 'suggestions'` - Analysis type for compatibility
  - `model: string` - AI model used for analysis
  - `version: string` - Analysis format version
- **JournalEntry Interface**: Includes optional `aiAnalysis?: AIAnalysis` field
- **UpdateJournalEntryInput**: Supports partial updates including `aiAnalysis`

### API Specifications
- No new API endpoints required - uses existing localStorage persistence
- Cache operations are handled client-side through journal store
- Analysis results are saved automatically after successful AI requests

### Component Specifications
- **useAIAnalysis Hook**: Enhanced with caching logic
  - Content change detection with configurable thresholds
  - Automatic cache loading and state synchronization
  - Smart cache reuse based on analysis type compatibility
- **MarkdownEditor**: Updated to display cached results immediately
- **AIAnalysisCard**: Handles both fresh and cached analysis results

### File Locations
- `src/features/ai-insights/hooks/useAIAnalysis.ts` - Main caching logic
- `src/features/journal/services/storageService.ts` - Cache persistence
- `src/shared/store/journalStore.ts` - Store integration
- `src/features/journal/types/journal.types.ts` - Type definitions

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for content change detection algorithm
- Integration tests for cache loading and saving
- Tests for analysis type compatibility logic
- Browser storage persistence tests

### Technical Constraints
- Cache size limited by localStorage browser limits (~5-10MB)
- Date serialization must handle timezone differences
- Cache invalidation based on content change thresholds
- Backward compatibility with existing journal entries

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `src/features/ai-insights/hooks/__tests__/useAIAnalysis.test.ts`
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for caching logic
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock localStorage and journal store operations

### Test Cases
1. **Content Change Detection Tests**
   - Test various content modification scenarios
   - Verify threshold calculations (50 characters, 20% change)
   - Test edge cases (empty content, very short content)

2. **Cache Loading Tests**
   - Test automatic cache loading on component mount
   - Verify state synchronization between hook and store
   - Test cache loading with different analysis types

3. **Cache Persistence Tests**
   - Test localStorage serialization/deserialization
   - Verify Date object handling in cache data
   - Test cache data integrity across browser sessions

4. **Analysis Type Compatibility Tests**
   - Test 'full' analysis satisfying 'summary' requests
   - Verify type-specific cache reuse logic
   - Test compatibility matrix for all analysis types
