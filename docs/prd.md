   ## 1. Goals and Background Context

   ### Goals

   * Provide users with a tool to systematically organize their daily thoughts and reflections.
   * Enable users to gain deeper self-awareness through AI-powered summaries and emotion analysis.
   * Offer intelligent insights and personalized suggestions to support emotional management and personal growth.
   * Showcase the developer's proficiency in front-end development and AI integration.

   ### Background Context

   Many individuals keep diaries or journals for self-reflection, but often struggle to derive actionable insights or identify long-term emotional patterns from their entries. Existing emotion diary applications frequently lack intelligent features, offering a dull experience without the benefit of deeper analysis. The "Insight Journal" project addresses these pain points by leveraging AI to transform raw journal entries into structured summaries, provide detailed emotion analysis, and generate personalized suggestions. This web application aims to enhance the user's self-awareness and emotional well-being by making daily reflection more insightful and engaging.

   ## 3. User Interface Design Goals

   This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision to guide the Design Architect and inform story creation. It is not a detailed UI specification but focuses on product vision and user goals.

   ### Overall UX Vision
   The overall user experience vision for Insight Journal is to provide a calm, intuitive, and supportive environment for daily reflection. The interface should feel personal and empathetic, encouraging consistent engagement and fostering a sense of well-being through thoughtful design and subtle interactions.

   ### Key Interaction Paradigms
   * **Effortless Journaling:** A clean and distraction-free interface for text input, promoting a seamless writing experience.
   * **Instant Insights:** Immediate feedback from AI analysis displayed clearly and concisely after journal submission.
   * **Intuitive Navigation:** Simple routing between the core journaling page and future historical views.
   * **Visual Feedback:** Use of subtle animations (e.g., during loading/analysis) and visual cues (e.g., emotion icons, color schemes) to enhance user understanding and engagement.

   ### Core Screens and Views
   From a product perspective, the most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the Insight Journal's values and goals are:

   * **Journaling Page (`/journal`):** The primary interface for users to write their daily notes, trigger AI analysis, and view the AI-generated summary, emotion analysis, and suggestions.
   * **Home Page (`/`):** An introductory page with a brief overview of the app's benefits and a clear Call to Action (CTA) to start journaling.

   ### Accessibility: None
   *Assumption: For MVP, basic accessibility best practices will be followed, but no specific WCAG compliance level (AA or AAA) is targeted.*

   ### Branding
   The branding should evoke a sense of calm and introspection.
   * **Color Palette:** Use soft color schemes, such as greens and blues, to create a meditative atmosphere.
   * **Animations:** Incorporate light animations, potentially using `framer-motion` for transitions and loading states, to provide a polished and responsive feel.
   * **Visual Cues:** Utilize emojis or simple graphical visualizations for daily emotion icons.

   ### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
   The application is primarily targeted as a web responsive application, ensuring a consistent and functional experience across desktop browsers and mobile devices.

   ## 4. Technical Assumptions

   This section gathers technical decisions that will guide the Architect. These choices become constraints for the Architect; therefore, it's crucial for them to be specific and complete.

   ### Repository Structure: Polyrepo
   * **Rationale:** Given the clear separation between a web application (frontend) and potentially a future backend API (though not in MVP), a Polyrepo structure is assumed to allow for independent deployment and development of different services. For the MVP, it will primarily contain the Next.js project.

   ### Service Architecture: Monolith (Frontend Application)
   * **Rationale:** The MVP is a self-contained frontend web application using `localStorage` for data persistence. This aligns with a monolithic frontend application architecture, simplifying initial deployment and development. Future phases might introduce separate backend services, but for MVP, it's a single deployable unit.

   ### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
   * **Rationale:** To ensure the stability and correctness of the application, Unit Tests will cover individual components and functions, and Integration Tests will verify the interaction between different parts of the frontend application and API integrations (e.g., OpenAI API calls). This provides a good balance for MVP quality assurance.

   ### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

   * **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js will be used for the main frontend development.
   * **Styling Framework:** Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent UI development.
   * **AI Integration:** OpenAI API will be used for all AI-powered features (summary, emotion analysis, suggestions). User's own API key will be required.
   * **State Management:** Zustand is a recommended choice for lightweight global state management within the frontend application.
   * **Animations:** `framer-motion` is suggested for handling animations, particularly during AI analysis loading states, to enhance user experience.
   * **Deployment Target:** Vercel is a strong candidate for deployment given the Next.js choice and ease of continuous deployment.
   * **Data Persistence:** `localStorage` will be the primary method for data storage in the MVP, with a clear understanding that this is a temporary solution for local data.
   * **Future Data Persistence:** Firebase/Supabase are noted as potential solutions for future cloud-based user authentication and data storage.
   * **Markdown Editor:** A suitable Markdown editor library will be integrated to support rich text/Markdown input for notes.
   * **Charting Library (Future):** For future data analysis features, `echarts`, `Recharts`, `Chart.js`, or `D3.js` are noted as potential charting libraries.
   * **Internationalization (Future):** `i18n` is noted for future multi-language support.
