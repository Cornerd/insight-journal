# Insight Journal Architecture Documentation

## üìã Architecture Overview

This document serves as the **main entry point** for the Insight Journal architecture documentation. The complete architecture has been restructured into a **sharded document system** for better maintainability, collaboration, and AI-driven development.

## üóÇÔ∏è Sharded Architecture Structure

The architecture documentation is now organized in the `docs/architecture/` directory with the following structure:

### üìñ **[Complete Architecture Index](./architecture/index.md)**
*Start here for navigation and role-based reading guides*

## üîß Core Architecture Documents

### Essential Documents (Always Loaded by AI Agents)
- **[Tech Stack](./architecture/tech-stack.md)** - Definitive technology selections and versions
- **[Coding Standards](./architecture/coding-standards.md)** - Mandatory rules for AI and human developers
- **[Source Tree](./architecture/source-tree.md)** - Project structure and file organization

### Foundation Documents
- **[High-Level Architecture](./architecture/high-level-architecture.md)** - System overview and architectural patterns
- **[Data Models](./architecture/data-models.md)** - Core business entities and relationships
- **[External APIs](./architecture/external-apis.md)** - Third-party service integrations
- **[Testing Strategy](./architecture/testing-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach

## üöÄ Quick Start for Different Roles

### For AI Development Agents
```
1. Read: tech-stack.md + coding-standards.md + source-tree.md
2. Context: data-models.md (when working with data)
3. Reference: testing-strategy.md (when writing tests)
```

### For Product Owners
```
1. Start: high-level-architecture.md
2. Review: external-apis.md
3. Understand: data-models.md
```

### For New Developers
```
1. Overview: high-level-architecture.md
2. Setup: tech-stack.md
3. Standards: coding-standards.md
4. Structure: source-tree.md
```

## üìä Architecture Summary

**Architecture Style**: Serverless + Component-Based Frontend
**Framework**: Next.js 14.2.5 with App Router
**Language**: TypeScript 5.3.3
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
**State Management**: Zustand 4.5.0
**AI Integration**: OpenAI API via Next.js API Routes
**Storage**: localStorage (MVP) ‚Üí Cloud Storage (Future)
**Deployment**: Vercel Platform

## üèóÔ∏è Migration from Monolithic Architecture

This document was previously a single monolithic architecture document. It has been **restructured into a sharded system** to support:

- **Better Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on different sections
- **AI Agent Efficiency**: Agents load only relevant sections for their tasks
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and version individual components
- **Role-Based Access**: Different roles can focus on relevant documentation

### Legacy Content Migration
All content from the original architecture document has been preserved and reorganized into the appropriate sharded documents:

- **Technical Summary** ‚Üí [High-Level Architecture](./architecture/high-level-architecture.md)
- **Technology Stack** ‚Üí [Tech Stack](./architecture/tech-stack.md)
- **Project Structure** ‚Üí [Source Tree](./architecture/source-tree.md)
- **Performance Guidelines** ‚Üí [Performance](./architecture/performance.md)
- **Data Models** ‚Üí [Data Models](./architecture/data-models.md)

## üîÑ Document Maintenance

### Version History
- **v2.0** (2025-07-22): Restructured to sharded architecture system
- **v1.0** (2025-07-20): Initial monolithic architecture document

### Update Process
1. **Individual Updates**: Modify specific sharded documents
2. **Cross-Document Changes**: Update multiple related documents
3. **Index Updates**: Update this main document when structure changes
4. **Story Updates**: Update related user stories when architecture changes

### Automated Validation
- **Link Checking**: Verify all internal links work
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensure cross-document consistency
- **Version Alignment**: Verify technology versions match across documents
