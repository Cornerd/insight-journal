# Story 2.3: Implement Emotion Analysis with AI

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see an AI-generated emotion analysis of my journal entry,
**so that** I can understand the prevailing sentiment and emotional themes within my writing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **2.3.1:** Following summarization, a request is made to the OpenAI API to analyze the sentiment of the journal entry (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
2. **2.3.2:** The AI output includes not only sentiment but also relevant emotion tags (e.g., "joy," "sadness," "anxiety," "calm").
3. **2.3.3:** The identified sentiment and emotion tags are prominently displayed on the journal entry view page, possibly using visual cues like emojis or color coding.
4. **2.3.4:** The emotion analysis results (sentiment and tags) are saved along with the journal entry in `localStorage`.
5. **2.3.5:** Prompt engineering is applied to ensure accurate and nuanced emotion detection from the AI.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1: Established OpenAI API integration
- Story 2.2: Implemented journal summarization
This story extends the AI analysis to include emotion detection and sentiment analysis.

### Data Models
**Enhanced AI Analysis with Emotions** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
interface AIAnalysis {
  summary: string;
  sentiment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
  emotions: EmotionTag[];
  confidence: number;
  generatedAt: Date;
  model: string;
  tokenUsage?: TokenUsage;
}

interface EmotionTag {
  name: string;
  intensity: number; // 0-1 scale
  emoji?: string;
}

// Predefined emotion categories
const EMOTION_CATEGORIES = [
  'joy', 'sadness', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise', 'disgust',
  'calm', 'anxiety', 'excitement', 'contentment', 'frustration',
  'hope', 'gratitude', 'loneliness', 'confidence', 'stress'
];
```

### API Specifications
**Enhanced AI Analysis Endpoint**:
- Route: `POST /api/ai/analyze`
- Request: `{ content: string, entryId: string, includeEmotions: boolean }`
- Response: `{ summary: string, sentiment: string, emotions: EmotionTag[], tokenUsage: object }`
- Processing: Combined or sequential API calls for efficiency

### Component Specifications
**EmotionTags Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/ai-insights/components/EmotionTags.tsx`
- Props: `{ emotions: EmotionTag[], sentiment: string }`
- Features: Color-coded tags, emoji indicators, intensity visualization
- Styling: Responsive tag layout with Tailwind CSS

**Enhanced AIAnalysisCard Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Updates: Include emotion display section
- Features: Summary + emotion analysis in unified card
- Layout: Organized sections for different analysis types

### File Locations
Based on Feature-Sliced Design pattern [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Emotion components: `src/features/ai-insights/components/EmotionTags.tsx`
- Updated AI card: `src/features/ai-insights/components/AIAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Prompt templates: `src/features/ai-insights/services/promptTemplates.ts`
- AI analysis types: `src/features/ai-insights/types/analysis.types.ts`
- Updated API route: `src/app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- OpenAI SDK 4.28.0 for emotion analysis
- React 18.2.0 for emotion display components
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 for emotion tag styling
- TypeScript 5.3.3 for type safety

**AI Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ai-integration]:
- Model: GPT-3.5-turbo for emotion analysis
- Temperature: 0.2 (more consistent emotion detection)
- Max tokens: 100-150 for emotion analysis
- Structured output: JSON format for parsing

**Performance Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture.md#performance]:
- Combine summary and emotion analysis in single API call when possible
- Cache emotion analysis results
- Implement progressive loading (summary first, then emotions)
- Optimize token usage for cost efficiency

### Prompt Engineering
**Emotion Analysis Prompt Template**:
```
System: You are an expert at analyzing emotions in personal writing. Analyze the emotional content of journal entries and provide structured output.

User: Analyze the emotions in this journal entry and provide:
1. Overall sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
2. Top 3-5 specific emotions with intensity (0-1 scale)
3. Confidence level in your analysis

Journal entry:
{journal_content}

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "emotions": [{"name": "emotion", "intensity": 0.8}],
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

### Visual Design
**Emotion Tag Styling** [Source: docs/architecture.md#branding]:
- Color palette: Soft colors matching app branding
- Emotion-specific colors: Joy (yellow), Sadness (blue), Anger (red), etc.
- Emoji integration: Visual emotion indicators
- Intensity visualization: Tag opacity or size based on intensity

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
- Framework: Jest 29.7.0 + Testing Library 14.2.1
- Test file location: `tests/unit/features/ai-insights/`
- Mock emotion analysis responses
- Test emotion parsing and validation
- Test visual emotion display components

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Successful emotion analysis and parsing
- Emotion tag display and styling
- Sentiment indicator functionality
- Error handling for invalid emotion data
- Integration with existing summary functionality
