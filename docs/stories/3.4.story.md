# Story 3.4: Implement Multi-Device Synchronization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to have my journal entries synchronized across all my devices,
**so that** I can write on one device and read on another seamlessly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **3.4.1:** Changes made on one device appear on other devices in real-time or near real-time.
2. **3.4.2:** Conflict resolution handles simultaneous edits from multiple devices.
3. **3.4.3:** Offline changes are synchronized when the device comes back online.
4. **3.4.4:** Users receive notifications about sync status and conflicts.
5. **3.4.5:** Sync works efficiently without excessive bandwidth usage.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement real-time synchronization (AC: 3.4.1)
  - [ ] Setup Supabase real-time subscriptions for journal entries
  - [ ] Implement real-time listeners for data changes
  - [ ] Create efficient data diffing and update mechanisms
  - [ ] Add debouncing to prevent excessive sync operations

- [ ] Task 2: Implement conflict resolution system (AC: 3.4.2)
  - [ ] Detect simultaneous edits using timestamps and version numbers
  - [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, merge, user-choice)
  - [ ] Create conflict resolution UI for user decisions
  - [ ] Store conflict history for audit purposes

- [ ] Task 3: Implement offline synchronization (AC: 3.4.3)
  - [ ] Create offline queue for pending changes
  - [ ] Implement connection status monitoring
  - [ ] Sync queued changes when connection is restored
  - [ ] Handle offline conflicts when coming back online

- [ ] Task 4: Implement sync status notifications (AC: 3.4.4)
  - [ ] Create sync status indicator in UI
  - [ ] Show notifications for sync events (success, conflicts, errors)
  - [ ] Implement toast notifications for important sync events
  - [ ] Add sync history log for troubleshooting

- [ ] Task 5: Optimize sync performance (AC: 3.4.5)
  - [ ] Implement incremental sync (only changed data)
  - [ ] Add data compression for large entries
  - [ ] Implement smart sync scheduling based on user activity
  - [ ] Add bandwidth usage monitoring and optimization

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Requires authentication system from Story 3.1
- Builds on cloud storage from Story 3.2
- May interact with migration system from Story 3.3

### Data Models
- **SyncStatus Interface**: Track synchronization state
  - `status: 'synced' | 'syncing' | 'offline' | 'conflict'` - Current sync state
  - `lastSync: Date` - Last successful sync timestamp
  - `pendingChanges: number` - Number of unsynced changes
- **ConflictEntry Interface**: Handle sync conflicts
  - `entryId: string` - Conflicted entry identifier
  - `localVersion: JournalEntry` - Local version of entry
  - `remoteVersion: JournalEntry` - Remote version of entry
  - `conflictType: 'content' | 'metadata' | 'both'` - Type of conflict
- **SyncQueue Interface**: Offline change queue
  - `operation: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete'` - Type of operation
  - `entryId: string` - Entry identifier
  - `data: any` - Operation data
  - `timestamp: Date` - When operation was queued

### API Specifications
- **Supabase Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Sync API**: `/api/sync/` endpoints for manual sync operations
- **Conflict Resolution API**: Handle conflict resolution requests
- **Status API**: Provide sync status and statistics

### Component Specifications
- **SyncProvider**: Context provider for sync state management
- **SyncStatusIndicator**: Visual indicator of sync status
- **ConflictResolver**: UI for resolving sync conflicts
- **OfflineQueue**: Manages offline change queue
- **SyncNotifications**: Toast notifications for sync events

### File Locations
- `src/features/sync/` - Synchronization components and logic
- `src/features/sync/services/syncService.ts` - Core sync logic
- `src/features/sync/hooks/useSync.ts` - Sync state management
- `src/features/sync/components/SyncStatus.tsx` - Status indicators
- `src/shared/store/syncStore.ts` - Global sync state

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for conflict detection and resolution
- Integration tests for real-time sync scenarios
- Offline/online transition testing
- Performance tests for large datasets and multiple devices

### Technical Constraints
- Must handle network latency and intermittent connections
- Sync operations must be efficient and not block UI
- Conflict resolution must preserve user data integrity
- Real-time updates must not overwhelm the system

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `src/features/sync/__tests__/`
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library, WebSocket mocking
- **Coverage**: Minimum 85% coverage for sync logic
- **Multi-device Testing**: Simulate multiple browser tabs/windows

### Test Cases
1. **Real-time Sync Tests**
   - Test real-time updates between multiple clients
   - Test sync performance with various data sizes
   - Test debouncing and rate limiting
   - Test WebSocket connection handling

2. **Conflict Resolution Tests**
   - Test detection of simultaneous edits
   - Test different conflict resolution strategies
   - Test user-driven conflict resolution
   - Test conflict history and audit trails

3. **Offline Sync Tests**
   - Test offline change queuing
   - Test sync when coming back online
   - Test offline conflict detection and resolution
   - Test data integrity during offline periods

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Test sync performance with large datasets
   - Test bandwidth usage optimization
   - Test sync scheduling and throttling
   - Test memory usage during sync operations
