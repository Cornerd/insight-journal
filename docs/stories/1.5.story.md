# Story 1.5: Delete Existing Journal Entries

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to delete existing journal entries,
**so that** I can remove unwanted or irrelevant reflections from my history.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **1.5.1:** An option (e.g., a "Delete" button or icon) is available for each entry in the journal history list or when viewing an individual entry.
2. **1.5.2:** Clicking "Delete" prompts the user for confirmation before permanent deletion.
3. **1.5.3:** Upon confirmation, the selected journal entry is permanently removed from `localStorage`.
4. **1.5.4:** The journal history list automatically updates to reflect the deletion.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1: Created journal page and markdown editor
- Story 1.2: Implemented localStorage saving functionality
- Story 1.3: Created journal list and entry detail views
- Story 1.4: Added editing capabilities for existing entries
This story completes the full CRUD operations by adding delete functionality.

### Data Models
**Delete Operation** [Source: docs/architecture.md#entities]:
```typescript
interface JournalEntry {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  title?: string;
}

// Delete operation does not require additional data models
// but affects the entries array in storage
```

### API Specifications
No external APIs required. All operations use localStorage through storage service.

### Component Specifications
**ConfirmDialog Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/shared/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
- Props: `{ isOpen: boolean, title: string, message: string, onConfirm: () => void, onCancel: () => void }`
- Features: Modal overlay, keyboard support, customizable styling
- Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and focus management

**Enhanced JournalCard Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/journal/components/JournalCard.tsx`
- Add delete button with proper positioning
- Implement hover states and visual feedback
- Handle delete action with confirmation

**Enhanced Storage Service** [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Location: `src/features/journal/services/storageService.ts`
- Add `deleteEntry(id: string)` function
- Implement atomic delete operations
- Handle storage errors and recovery

### File Locations
Based on Feature-Sliced Design pattern [Source: docs/architecture.md#project-structure]:
- Confirm dialog: `src/shared/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
- Journal card: `src/features/journal/components/JournalCard.tsx`
- Entry detail: `src/app/journal/[id]/page.tsx`
- Storage service: `src/features/journal/services/storageService.ts`
- Journal store: `src/shared/store/journalStore.ts`
- Delete hooks: `src/features/journal/hooks/useDeleteEntry.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- React 18.2.0 for component state and effects
- Zustand 4.5.0 with Immer for state management
- Next.js 14.2.5 App Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 for styling
- localStorage API for data persistence

**UX Patterns** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ui-pattern]:
- Confirmation before destructive actions
- Clear visual feedback for delete operations
- Proper error handling and user communication
- Smooth transitions and animations

**Error Handling** [Source: docs/architecture.md#error-handling]:
- Handle localStorage access errors
- Provide fallback for failed delete operations
- Clear error messages for users
- Graceful degradation when storage unavailable

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture.md#development-tools]:
- Framework: Jest 29.7.0 + Testing Library 14.2.1
- Test file location: `tests/unit/features/journal/`
- Test delete UI interactions
- Test confirmation dialog behavior
- Test storage operations and error scenarios
- Mock localStorage for consistent testing

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Delete button visibility and functionality
- Confirmation dialog flow
- Successful deletion and UI updates
- Error handling and recovery
- Navigation after deletion
- Keyboard accessibility

**Edge Cases to Test**:
- Deleting non-existent entries
- Storage quota issues during delete
- Concurrent delete operations
- Network interruption scenarios
